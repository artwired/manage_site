Worked on styling the spacing for the main nav and was exposed to CSS clamp which I need to explore more. It was very cool how it allowed the spacing to adjust without allowing the nav elements to crash into the surrounding divs. I also worked on the vertical spacing of the first 2 sections. Here I learned about > * + * which also need to do some further study in.

Worked on creating a gradient that blocks out everything behind the mobile nav when the mobile menu is openned.

Worked on the navigation layout and some javascript for hiding and revealing mobile navigation. It's very cool to learn how to set attributes based on whether aria-expanded is set to true or false.

Worked on the visual spacing for the sections and the styling for the buttons. I also got started on the styling for the hamburger menu. Learned about using a data-type to target elements in css that are similar but are presented differently.
